// ************** OOP *************
/*
 Q.) What is OOP?
  OOP is a paradigm of programming based on concepts of classes and objects
  objects are used as to model real world entites 
  objects contains properties and methods with which we can pack properties and behaviour in one block
  objects are building block on an application and can interact with each other through APIs method through 
  which outside code can interact with objects

  OOP was developed to organize and make our code more flexible and reliable and eaiser to maintain.

/* CLASS
  A class can be defined as a blueprint through which new objects can be created
  Ex. Js do not support classes like this just an example
* Class
  User{
    user
    pass
    name
    email
    login(pass){}
   }
     * Instance/OBJ
     {
       user="as",
       pas="***",
       email="@gmail"
     }

// ******** PILLARS OF OOPS *********
/*
    There are four main pillars of OOP : 
    1. Encapsulation
    2. Abstraction
    3. Inhertiance
    4. Polymorphism
*/

// ** Encapsulation **
/*
 Keeping properties and methods private inside a class so that they are not accessible by outside the class
 Some methods can be accessible via public interface
 Binding the code into one class to make it secure relaible and reuseable
 */

// ** Abstraction **
/*
 Hiding details that dont not matter for the user 
 Allowing it get a breif perspective of how things are working
 Instead of letting user manipulate the implementation
 */
// ** Inheritance **
/*
 This method is simply used for making the metohds and properties of the current class available to the class
 that extends it . The child class inherits the properties of the parent class
 Introduces heirarchy in the code  
*/
// ** Polymorphism **
/*
 This technique is used to overwrite the methods in the super/parent class
